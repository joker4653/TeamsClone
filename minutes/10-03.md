# Meeting of the Badgers
### March 10, 2022 from 12:30 to 13:00

Today we met for the first time after submitting iteration 1 and iteration 2 being released.
 * We discussed what we could do differently for iteration 2.
 * Decided to fix up some of the basic bugs that caused a lot of tests to fail for a rerun.
 * Functions from the iteration were allocated for each person to complete.
 * Talked about how need to be using the taskboard and meeting more to avoid losing marks.
 * Joseph decided to implement the stubs for each of the http wrapper functions in `src/server.py`.
