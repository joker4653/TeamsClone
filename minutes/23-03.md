# Meeting of the Badgers
### March 23, 2022 from 10:00 to 10:30

 * First we talked about implementing the HTTP tests. A few tests have already been implemented and we discussed how the error codes work so everyone is now 100% clear on what to do. 
 * We also mentioned how many of the test cases will overlap and there is no need to be duplicating coverage of certain cases.
 * We brought up how dms are essentially just channels with 2 people so implementing the functionality should be extremely simple
 * JWTs token were discussed, specifically how the functions will handle them and convert them to valid user ids or if not then how they can handle the errors.
 * Laura brought to our attention that the import path needed to be changed as we are running the http test from a different directory.
 * Lastly we discussed how we can adapt iteration 1 tests to HTTP tests.
