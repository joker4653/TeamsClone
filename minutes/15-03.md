### March 15, 2022 from 13:05 to 13:40

 * Firstly, we discussed the the challenges in understanding the HTTP aspects of the iteration, how we will use the functions as wrappers for the iteration 1 functions, and how the testing will work using HTTP status codes.

 * We discussed pylint and code coverage for passing the pipelines
