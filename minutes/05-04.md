* discussed storage of details required for users statistics (analytics). Decided to store channels and dms joined and messages sent as lists of channel, dm and message id's respectively.
* reviewed test results after our re-run. Identified remaining problems and assigned group members to check these problems in the functions.
* mentioned the idea of logging a user out after they are removed and also checking a user has not been removed before logging them in to resolve a failing test for user remove function.
* discussed issue with dm_create adding duplicate users; found issue was with arguments that the function was being passed rather than the function itself.
* Nick noted that when handling message pin and unpin he was able to call one function to perform the functionality for both; brought up for Rumman who is doing react and unreact which could likely also be handled in this way.
