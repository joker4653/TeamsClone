 - worked through deployment of backend to Anydata together. Rumman had deployed the backend earlier, still various problems such as default image not currently accessible so it is not displayed correctly. Worked through some of these issues and agreed to meet later to finalise remaining problems.
 - discussed an issue with user data not being updated in channels and dms of which the user is currently a member following any changes (eg. name change). Nick agreed to write the function to fix this.
 - discussed the conceptual model that Sagar had made; agreed that it covered the specifications correctly.
 - had a look for bugs in dm functions that may have caused some iteration 2 tests to fail, couldn't find the cause of any problems.
 - played around with frontend locally to conferm that user and workspace statistics appeared to be working correctly.
