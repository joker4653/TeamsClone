 * Laura and Nick will refactor old code from iteration 1 to improve the way that the channels data is stored.
 * Joseph put up merge request after fixing up the pylint errors from iteration 1
 * We discussed code coverage and how our tests need to cover 100% of the lines in our programs.
 * We discussed the persistence of data in detail and how we will write function to read and write back to a JSON file to store data on the backend functions.
 * Discussed how we should be commenting more, adding docstrings and making sure to use the taskboard.
