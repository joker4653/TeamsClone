 * The meeting was just to catch up on what everyone is up to. Sagar and Joseph could not attend.
 * Firstly we discussed HTTP tests and we confirmed exactly what we are meant to be doing in regards to writing the tests.
 * We discussed the code refactor and how everyone has complete so we can move forward and merge the branch into master
 * We discussed how session management will work using tokens and JWT.
 * We decided that we can meet more frequently in the future even if everyone isn't available to help each other out with their code.
