 - Distributed remaining iteration 2 functions that had not yet been distributed.
 - Worked through a bug together in dm branch.
 - Discussed the need to add a call to clear at the end of each test file to ensure that json data files are left empty.
 - Conftest.py was discussed, everyone on the same page about being able to put their fixtures that they create into this file and access them without needing to import.
 - Talked about our coverage level; two big local branches still yet to be merged so after they are added to main we'll check to make sure our coverage is high enough.
 - Talked about function doc strings; will try to add doc strings as outlined in the assignment spec to all functions.
